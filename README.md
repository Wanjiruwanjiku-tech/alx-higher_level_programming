HIGHER LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
----------------------------------------------

- A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages.

C
-----------------------------

![c](https://github.com/Wanjiruwanjiku-tech/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/Project_images/C.jpg?raw=true)

- C is both a high-level programming language and a middle-level programming language. To clarify, C has always been known as a high-level language. 

Example:

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main() {
            printf("Hello World!");
            return 0;
            }

PYTHON
--------------------

- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Example:

        # Simple Python program
        # Ask the user for their name
        user_name = input("What is your name? ")
        
        # Print a personalized greeting
        print(f"Hello, {user_name}! Welcome to Python programming.")

JavaScript
------------------

![JavaScript](https://github.com/Wanjiruwanjiku-tech/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/Project_images/js.jpg?raw=true)

- JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web along with HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows you to add interactivity, manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), and communicate with servers to create responsive and engaging web applications.

Example

        // Standalone JavaScript code
        // Prompt the user for their name
        var userName = prompt("What is your name?");
        
        // Display a personalized greeting in the console
        console.log("Hello, " + userName + "! Welcome to our website.");


SQL
-------------------------

- Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is used to perform tasks such as querying data, updating data, inserting data, and deleting data from a database.

Example

        CREATE TABLE employees (
            id INT PRIMARY KEY,
            first_name VARCHAR(50),
            last_name VARCHAR(50),
            salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
            );
