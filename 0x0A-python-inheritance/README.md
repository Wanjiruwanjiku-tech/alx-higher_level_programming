PYTHON INHERITANCE

Inheritance is a Mechanism whereby one is allowed to create a hierarchy if Classes that share a set of properties by deriving one class from another


The class derived is known as the subclass and the class derived from goes by superclass or baseclass or parentclass.

Basic syntax:

		class Baseclass: #The parent
			{The Body}
		class Derivedclass(Baseclass): #The child
			{The Body}

The child process inherits the properries of the parent including attributes and methods.

This project aims to dig deeper into inheritance
