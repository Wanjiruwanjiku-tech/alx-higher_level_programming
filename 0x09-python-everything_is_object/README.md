PYTHON - Everything is object

Background Context

Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, letâ€™s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to? I mean:


		>>> a = 1
		>>> b = a
		>>> a = 2
		>>> b
		1
		>>>

OK. But what about this?


		>>> l = [1, 2, 3]
		>>> m = l
		>>> l[0] = 'x'
		>>> m
		['x', 2, 3]
		>>>
