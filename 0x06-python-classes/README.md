A Class is like a blueprint that defines the structure of Objects or Instances where objects are instances of the very same class that creates them

Classes and Objecte are used in special programming paradigm called Object Oreinted Programming (OPP)

This project focuses on Classes and objects

- How to create a class

		class my_class:
			pass

		class my_class:
			def say_hello(self):
				print(Hello)
		my_class().say_hello()
