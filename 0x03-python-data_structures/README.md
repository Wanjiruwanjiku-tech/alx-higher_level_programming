A list is a collection of items that are ordered and mutable. They are denoted by square brackets ([]) and can contain any data type (strings, integers, characters e.t.c) as well as other lists and tuple

		my_list = [3, 4, 5, 6]

- A Tuple is similar to a list in that it is also a collection of ordered items BUT they are immutable. They are denoted by parenthesis( () ) and they can also contain any data type

		my_tuple = (3, 4, 5, 6)

This project will go deeper into Lists and Tuples under the topic Python Data Structures. We will learn how to create, use, modify, slice, indext e.t.c both lists and tuples
